Technical Analysis Dashboard v4.48 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Strategy 1: “1. Forex AGGRESSIVE Trend-Following” 
1. Aggressive Scalping (S1) 
 Components: Moving Average and RSI. 
 MA Settings: 20 EMA. 
 RSI Settings: Period 7, Mode = Reversal, Bands at 50 / 50. 
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 2.5 (TP & SL) 
 Trailing SL: 30% 
 Timeframe: M5 
 Signal Mode: State Based 
How It Will Behave (The Rule Set) 
This strategy uses a single MA as a basic trend filter and a very fast RSI crossover of the 50
level as its entry trigger. 
 BUY Signal Rule: 
1. Trend Context: The price must be ABOVE the 20 EMA. 
2. Entry Trigger: The 7-period RSI must cross back UP from BELOW 50. 
 SELL Signal Rule: 
1. Trend Context: The price must be BELOW the 20 EMA. 
2. Entry Trigger: The 7-period RSI must cross back DOWN from ABOVE 50. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: This is a pure momentum-shift strategy designed for high-frequency 
trading. The 20 EMA provides a simple, dynamic bias: "Are we generally heading up or 
down right now?" The strategy then ignores all other indicators and focuses intensely 
on one thing: the exact moment short-term momentum shifts, as defined by the RSI 
crossing its centerline. It’s designed to catch the very first spark of a micro-move. 
 Strengths: 
o Extremely Fast: Using a 7-period RSI on an M5 chart makes this one of the 
fastest-reacting strategies possible. It will generate signals very early in a 
move. 
o High Activity: It will find numerous trading opportunities during active market 
sessions, which is ideal for a scalper's mindset. 
o Clear Logic: The rules are simple and unambiguous, allowing for rapid 
decision-making. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o Highly Susceptible to Whipsaws: Its speed is its greatest weakness. In a 
choppy, non-trending market, the price and RSI will oscillate around the 20 EMA 
and the 50-level, generating a series of small, frustrating losses. 
o No Strength Confirmation: It does not measure how strong the momentum is, 
only that it has shifted. A weak crossover can easily fail. It relies on the scalper 
to manage trades actively. 
2. Aggressive Daytrading (S2) 
 Components: Two Moving Averages and RSI. 
 MA Settings: 20 EMA and 50 EMA. 
 RSI Settings: Period 14, Mode = Trend, Bands at 65 / 35. 
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 3.5 (TP & SL) 
 Trailing SL: 25% 
 Timeframe: H1 
 Signal Mode: State Based 
How It Will Behave (The Rule Set) 
This is a classic continuation or "breakout" strategy. It waits for the trend to be established 
and then joins the move when momentum is proven to be exceptionally strong. 
 BUY Signal Rule: 
1. Trend Alignment: Price must be ABOVE the 20 EMA AND ABOVE the 50 EMA. 
2. Momentum Trigger: The 14-period RSI must be ABOVE 65. 
 SELL Signal Rule: 
1. Trend Alignment: Price must be BELOW the 20 EMA AND BELOW the 50 EMA. 
2. Momentum Trigger: The 14-period RSI must be BELOW 35. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: This strategy operates on the principle of "strength begets strength." It 
doesn't try to predict bottoms or tops. Instead, it waits for the market to show a clear, 
unified trend (via the 20/50 EMA alignment) and then waits for an explosive push of 
momentum (RSI > 65). The core idea is to join a trend that is already in progress and 
demonstrating significant power. 
 Strengths: 
o Catches Strong Moves: When a currency pair makes a strong, directional move 
for the day, this strategy is designed to capture the most powerful leg of that 
move. 
o Avoids Counter-Trend Traps: By strictly following the alignment of two MAs, it 
will never try to buy in a clear downtrend or sell in an uptrend. 
o Clear Confirmation: An RSI reading above 65 is a strong, undeniable signal of 
bullish dominance, reducing ambiguity. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o Buying High, Selling Low: By its very nature, it will always enter a trade after a 
significant move has already occurred. The risk is buying near a short-term top 
right before a pullback. 
o Can Suffer in "Slow Grind" Trends: If a trend moves up slowly without a strong 
momentum push, the RSI might never reach the 65 level, causing the strategy 
to miss the entire move. 
3. Aggressive Swing Trading (S3) 
 Components: Moving Average and CCI. 
 MA Settings: 50 SMA (Simple Moving Average) 
 CCI Settings: Period 50, Mode = Trend, Bands at 100 / -100. 
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 4 (TP & SL) 
 Timeframe: D1 (Daily) 
 Trailing SL: 20% 
 Signal Mode: State Based 
How It Will Behave (The Rule Set) 
This strategy uses a major daily moving average to define the long-term landscape and a 
powerful CCI signal to enter with force. 
 BUY Signal Rule: 
1. Macro Trend: The price must be ABOVE the 50 SMA on the Daily chart. 
2. Breakout Trigger: The 50-period CCI must cross ABOVE +100. 
 SELL Signal Rule: 
1. Macro Trend: The price must be BELOW the 50 SMA on the Daily chart. 
2. Breakout Trigger: The 50-period CCI must cross BELOW -100. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: This is a swing trader's breakout strategy. The 50 SMA on the daily chart 
is a widely watched level that defines the medium-to-long-term trend. The strategy 
uses this as its only bias. The entry trigger—a 50-period CCI crossing the 100-level—is 
a signal of exceptionally strong momentum over the last two months of trading. It's 
designed to enter when the market makes a decisive, powerful move in the direction of 
the established trend. 
 Strengths: 
o Trades with Major Market Flow: By keying off the 50 SMA on the daily chart, it 
aligns itself with the dominant, institutional trend. 
o High-Impact Entries: A CCI(50) cross of the 100-level is not a subtle event; it 
signifies a major shift in market psychology and momentum, often leading to 
significant follow-through. 
o Simplicity and Power: It uses only two, very powerful concepts, making it 
robust and easy to understand. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o Infrequent Signals: This is a very patient strategy. You may go many weeks or 
even months without a signal on a single pair. 
o Large Stop-Loss Requirements: Entering on such a strong momentum signal 
means the price is already volatile. This will often require a wider stop loss than 
a pullback-based strategy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Strategy 2: “2. Forex CONSERVATIVE Trend-Following” 
1. Conservative Momentum Scalping (S1) 
This strategy is designed to be a high-precision, low-frequency scalping system. It only takes 
trades when a trend is not just present, but actively accelerating, giving a higher probability 
that the move has enough momentum to reach its target. 
Parameter Settings (S1) 
 Timeframe: M15 
 Signal Mode: State Based 
 MA Settings: 20 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) 
 ADX Settings: 
o ADX Mode: Trending 
o ADX Period: 14 
o ADX Level: 25 
o Momentum Check: ADX Rising 
o Momentum Bars: 2  
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 2.5 (TP & SL) 
 Trailing SL: 30% 
How It Will Behave (The Refined Rule Set) 
This strategy now uses a three-stage confirmation process before generating a signal. 
BUY Signal Rule: 
A BUY signal is generated only if all three of the following conditions are true on the last 
closed M15 candle: 
1. Directional Bias: The price is ABOVE the 20 EMA. 
2. Trend Strength: The 14-period ADX value is ABOVE 25. 
3. Accelerating Momentum: The ADX value has been RISING for the last 2 consecutive 
candles. 
SELL Signal Rule: 
A SELL signal is generated only if all three of the following conditions are true: 
1. Directional Bias: The price is BELOW the 20 EMA. 
2. Trend Strength: The 14-period ADX value is ABOVE 25. 
3. Accelerating Momentum: The ADX value has been RISING for the last 2 consecutive 
candles. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: The philosophy evolves from "No Trend, No Trade" 
to "No Accelerating Trend, No Trade." The addition of the momentum check is critical. 
It acts as a final confirmation, ensuring the strategy doesn't enter a strong trend that is 
already running out of steam. It aims to catch the "power wave" of a move, not the 
beginning or the end. 
 Strengths: 
o Superior Signal Quality: This is the biggest upgrade. By requiring the ADX to 
be rising, the strategy filters out established but "tired" trends, drastically 
reducing the risk of entering just before a consolidation or reversal. 
o Excellent Chop Filter: The base ADX > 25 filter remains a powerful tool for 
avoiding noisy, ranging markets. 
o Higher Probability Targets: Entering on building momentum increases the 
statistical probability that the move has enough "fuel" to reach the 2.5x ATR 
take-profit target. 
o Capital Preservation: By being even more selective, it further protects capital 
from suboptimal trading conditions. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o Extreme Patience Required: This is now an extremely conservative scalping 
strategy. The three-part filter means signals will be rare and only appear in the 
most ideal conditions. Do not expect constant action. 
o Designed to Miss the Start: The strategy is, by design, a confirmation system. It 
will not catch the absolute beginning of a move. It waits for the move to prove 
itself first. 
o May Miss Mature Trends: A very strong, mature trend might continue for a long 
time even if the ADX is flat or slightly declining at a high level (e.g., above 40). 
The momentum filter will cause the strategy to ignore these valid, albeit 
mature, trend continuation opportunities. 
2. Conservative Daytrading (S2) 
 Components: Moving Average and RSI. 
 MA Settings: 100 EMA. 
 RSI Settings: Period 14, Mode = Reversal, Bands at 70 / 30. 
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 3.5 (TP & SL) 
 Trailing SL: 25% 
 Timeframe: H1 
 Signal Mode: State Based 
How It Will Behave (The Rule Set) 
This is the classic "buy the dip in a confirmed uptrend" strategy. It uses a long-term MA to 
define the only acceptable trade direction and then waits patiently for a low-risk entry point. 
 BUY Signal Rule: 
1. Master Trend: The price must be ABOVE the 100 EMA. 
2. Entry Trigger: The 14-period RSI, having been in oversold territory (<30), 
must cross back UP above 30. 
 SELL Signal Rule: 
1. Master Trend: The price must be BELOW the 100 EMA. 
2. Entry Trigger: The 14-period RSI, having been in overbought territory (>70), 
must cross back DOWN below 70. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: This strategy combines two powerful trading tenets: "The trend is your 
friend" and "Buy low, sell high." The 100 EMA on the H1 chart acts as a robust filter for 
the dominant intraday trend. By refusing to take any signal that goes against this MA, 
the strategy avoids the most dangerous trades. It then waits for the price to pull back 
to a point of short-term exhaustion (RSI oversold/overbought) before entering, 
providing a much better risk-to-reward entry than chasing breakouts. 
 Strengths: 
o Superior Risk Management: Entering on a pullback inherently provides a more 
favorable entry price and a more logical location for a stop-loss (e.g., just below 
the recent swing low). 
o High Probability: The combination of trading with the dominant trend and 
entering on a confirmed reversal from an extreme is a very high-probability 
setup. 
o Reduces "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO): It trains the trader to wait for the price 
to come to them, rather than chasing moves that have already happened. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o Can Miss V-Shaped Rallies: In extremely strong, parabolic trends, the price 
may not pull back enough for the RSI to become oversold, causing the strategy 
to miss the entire move. 
o Failed Pullbacks: In a weakening trend, a pullback may fail to reverse and 
instead signal the start of a larger trend change against the 100 EMA. 
3. Conservative Swing Trading (S3) 
This is an institutional-grade, multi-filtered strategy designed to only participate in the most 
powerful and established secular trends that are actively gaining momentum. 
Parameter Settings (S3) 
 Timeframe: D1 (Daily) 
 Signal Mode: State Mode 
 MA Settings: 50 SMA and 200 SMA (Simple Moving Average) 
 ADX Settings: 
o ADX Mode: Trending 
o ADX Period: 14 
o ADX Level: 25 
o Momentum Check: ADX Rising 
o Momentum Bars: 3 (Using 3 bars on Daily gives a stronger confirmation of 
building momentum) 
 ATR: Period 14, Multiplier 4.0 (TP & SL) 
 Trailing SL: 20% 
How It Will Behave (The Refined Rule Set) 
This strategy now uses a powerful four-stage confirmation process before committing to a 
long-term position. 
BUY Signal Rule: 
A BUY signal is generated only if all four of the following conditions are true on the last closed 
Daily candle: 
1. Secular Trend: The price is ABOVE the 200 SMA. 
2. Primary Trend: The price is ABOVE the 50 SMA. 
3. Trend Strength: The 14-period ADX value is ABOVE 25. 
4. Accelerating Momentum: The ADX value has been RISING for the last 3 consecutive 
days. 
SELL Signal Rule: 
A SELL signal is generated only if all four of the following conditions are true: 
1. Secular Trend: The price is BELOW the 200 SMA. 
2. Primary Trend: The price is BELOW the 50 SMA. 
3. Trend Strength: The 14-period ADX value is ABOVE 25. 
4. Accelerating Momentum: The ADX value has been RISING for the last 3 consecutive 
days. 
Discussion & Analysis 
 Philosophy: This strategy evolves from simple trend-following to momentum-driven 
trend participation. It still demands an overwhelming confluence of evidence, but now 
adds a crucial timing element. It's not enough for the trend to exist; it must be actively 
strengthening. This is designed to position the trader at the start of the most powerful 
"thrust" phase of a long-term economic cycle, improving the probability of achieving 
the large 4x ATR target. 
 Strengths: 
o Maximum Quality Confirmation: This is arguably the highest quality signal this 
dashboard can produce. It combines long-term, medium-term, strength, and 
momentum filters. False signals are exceptionally rare. 
o Improved Entry Timing: By waiting for rising ADX, the strategy avoids entering 
a "good" trend at a "bad" time (e.g., just as it begins to consolidate). It aims to 
enter when institutional momentum is building. 
o "Set and Forget" Confidence: The additional momentum filter provides even 
greater confidence to hold the position for the long term, trusting that the 
underlying market force is strong. 
 Weaknesses / Things to Watch for: 
o The Ultimate Test of Patience: If the previous version was a test of patience, 
this version is a test of extreme patience. The four-part filter is so strict that 
there may be years without a valid signal on some pairs. 
o Even More Lagging: The momentum requirement adds another layer of lag. 
The strategy is now even more certain to miss the start of a trend. Its sole 
purpose is to capture the "heart" of the move with the highest possible 
probability. 
o Whipsaw on ADX: On the daily chart, it's possible for the ADX to rise for a few 
days and then dip for a day before rising again. The strict "rising for 3 bars" rule 
might cause it to miss entries that a human trader might still consider valid.
